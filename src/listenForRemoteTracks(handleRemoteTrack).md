## listenForRemoteTracks(handleRemoteTrack):
```
  const videoRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleRemoteTrack = (remoteStream) => {
      if (videoRef.current) videoRef.current.srcObject = remoteStream;
    };
  
    listenForRemoteTracks(handleRemoteTrack);
  
    return () => {
      peerConnection.ontrack = null; // remove the listener
      if (videoRef.current?.srcObject) {
        videoRef.current.srcObject.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
        videoRef.current.srcObject = null;
      }
    };
  }, []);  
```
```
    export function listenForRemoteTracks(onRemoteStream) {
    const remoteStream = new MediaStream();
    peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
      event.streams[0].getTracks().forEach(track => {
        if (!remoteStream.getTracks().includes(track)) {
          remoteStream.addTrack(track);
        }
      });
      onRemoteStream(remoteStream);
    };
  }
```

  The cleanup in the React component's useEffect consists of hook useRef(videoRef) belonging to the component and server's variables(peerConnection and its props and methods: ontrack, getTracks, stop). 
  Why such a mix happens:


When you pass handleRemoteTrack to listenForRemoteTracks, you’re giving the server module a callback closure.

The server just calls your function(handleRemoteTrack) whenever a remote track arrives.

so when i do 
const handleRemoteTrack = (remoteStream) => {
      if (videoRef.current) videoRef.current.srcObject = remoteStream;
    };
 the remoteStream is stored in the useRef and that lead to the useeffect's cleanup being able to use the server funcs .ontrack etc?

Needed for cleanup.

handleRemoteTrack = (remoteStream) =>
onRemoteStream(remoteStream);

listenForRemoteTracks(onRemoteStream) accepts a callback function because the react component has no access to server variable,  and it can send the server variables to the react component to use remoteStream(remoteStream is the whole MediaStream object created in your “server” module(where peerConnection.ontrack adds tracks)) by onRemoteStream(remoteStream)
Assigning it to videoRef.current.srcObject does not copy it, it just stores a reference to the same object inside the <video> element.
This means both the server module and the React component share the same MediaStream instance.

Perfect summary — you’ve almost got it all pieced together 🎯
Let me just clear up the last bit of confusion about why cleanup in the React component can touch “server variables” like peerConnection.ontrack and remoteStream.

🔗 The chain of references

Server module (listenForRemoteTracks)

Creates one remoteStream = new MediaStream().

Hooks into peerConnection.ontrack and fills remoteStream with tracks from the peer.

Calls your callback:
