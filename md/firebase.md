Ah, yes — this is an important subtlety with Firebase Realtime Database. Let’s break it down carefully.

Your function:
export const addAcceptCallToDb = async (calleeId, callKey) => {
    await set(ref(db, `users/${calleeId}/incomingCall/${callKey}/accepted`), true);
}

Step 1: What ref(db, path) does

    ref(db, "users/${calleeId}/incomingCall/${callKey}/accepted") points exactly to that node in the database.

    In Firebase RTDB, nodes are hierarchical.

    If the path doesn’t exist yet, Firebase will create it automatically.
    So if you only have:

users/
  calleeId/
    incomingCall/
      callKey/

And accepted does not exist yet, Firebase will create the accepted key under that callKey node.
Step 2: What set() does

    set(ref, value) writes exactly the value at the given reference.

    It overwrites anything at that path, but it does not touch siblings higher up.

    So in your case:

users/calelerId/incomingCall/callKey/

Currently might be:

{
  "callId": "abc123",
  "callerId": "uid123",
  "callerName": "Andy",
  "accepted": null
}

After calling addAcceptCallToDb(calleeId, callKey):
{
  "callId": "abc123",
  "callerId": "uid123",
  "callerName": "Andy",
  "accepted": true
}

✅ The accepted field is updated. No other parts of users/... are affected.
Step 3: Why it looks like "creating something on top"

    It seems like “adding a key on top” because Firebase will create the accepted key if it doesn’t exist.

    But it’s actually nested inside the existing callKey node — not overwriting the whole call, only that field.

    Think of it like updating a nested property of an object.

⚠ Caution

    If you did:

set(ref(db, `users/${calleeId}/incomingCall/${callKey}`), { accepted: true });

This would overwrite the whole callKey node, erasing callId, callerId, callerName. That’s why you include /accepted at the end of the path.

✅ Summary

ref(db, path/to/accepted) points to a single field inside the call node.
set(ref, true) updates that field or creates it if it doesn’t exist.
Nothing above or beside it is touched.
This is the correct way to mark a call as accepted without losing other call data.
